*The bot is not up yet but will be soon. I've had to rewrite the website

## About
Knaughts bot is created in Java with the [JDA](https://github.com/discord-jda/JDA) Discord wrapper. 
It uses [Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io) as its database and [lazysodium](https://github.com/terl/lazysodium-java) for encryption.
